# MIG23MLD Flight Stick Clone

## Before starting
Currently grip & button design is prototype. It is too hard to assemble, no trigger group.... <br>
And also it is not 100% replica of Mig23MLD flight stick. My laziness + lack of cad skill lead to 80% clone of original.<br>
Will be improved soon!

## Credits
Based on okulele's gimbal design : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2496028 <br>

## How to assemble this thing?
Full Assembly will look like this : https://cad.onshape.com/documents/41b159342893432992f2dc4f/w/2e32bb2981abb629ef604ac7/e/049652f066491f72423e1957


BoM & Notes:<br>
dimension is slightly different from original design. Just because I used cheaper & available one. 
Also used sleeve bearings on cams for lower cost.

- Bearing 6901zz * 4
- Bearing MR115zz * 4
- Sleeve Bearing GFM-0507-11 * 4
- Sleeve Bearing GFM-0709-10 * 4
- M5x25 cross head/hex bolt * 7
- M5x35 countersunk/hex bolt * 4
- M5x35 cross head/hex bolt * 12
- M5 spring washer * 10
- M5 nut * 23
- M3x6 cross head/hex bolt * 6 (optional)

- [PS1024ALRED](https://github.com/tiktrimo/MIG23MLD-Joystick-Gimbal/blob/main/images/20210718_0329.png) * 1 (Push button)
- [TH101010](https://github.com/tiktrimo/MIG23MLD-Joystick-Gimbal/blob/main/images/Image%20001.png) * 2 (5 Way button)

Used WSH135-XPAN2 Hall effect sensor. This was cheapest in store and cost about 50 cent. With 4x4x10mm neodymium magnet it gives 500 steps on each axis.


## Recommendation
I recommend to change gap between buttons and head. Currently gap is set to 0.15mm. For my printer 0.15mm gap gives me perfect fit with click! sound.
