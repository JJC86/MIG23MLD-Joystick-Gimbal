# MIG23MLD Flight Stick Clone

## Before starting
Currently grip & button design is prototype. It is too hard to assemble and will be changed soon. </br>
And also it is not 100% replica of Mig23MLD flight stick. My laziness + lack of cad skill lead to 80% clone of original.

## Credits
Based on okulele's gimbal design : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2496028 </br>
Used rdbeerman's cad files : https://github.com/rdbeerman/Joystick-Gimbal </br>
Used Murat Vishnyakov's KG13 Grip cad file : https://grabcad.com/library/kg-13-flight-control-grip-1 </br>
Referenced GGE2142's Mig23 Flight stick's 3d design : https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/mig-23mld-flight-stick-855707656b494a63adcc3c0fc8ba19b1 </br>

## How to assemble this thing?
Full Assembly will look like this : https://cad.onshape.com/documents/41b159342893432992f2dc4f/w/2e32bb2981abb629ef604ac7/e/049652f066491f72423e1957


BoM & Notes:
dimension is slightly different from original design. Just because I used cheaper one. 
Also used sleeve bearings on cams for lower cost. 

- Bearing 6901zz * 4
- Bearing MR115zz * 4
- Sleeve Bearing GFM-0507-11 * 4
- Sleeve Bearing GFM-0709-10 * 4

- M5x25 cross head/hex bolt * 3
- M5x35 countersunk/hex bolt * 6
- M5x35 cross head/hex bolt * 4
- M5 spring washer * 10
- M5 nut * 19
- M3x6 cross head/hex bolt

## Recommendation
I recommend to change dimmension of clearances between buttons and head. Currently clearance is set 0.15mm. For my printer 0.15mm gap gives me perfect fit with click! sound.
